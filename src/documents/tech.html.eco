            <h3>Founder & Technical Director, Michael Mooring.</h3>
            <p>
                Michael had his first computer when he was 3 and has been dreaming of ways technology can 
                fill gaps in society ever since. With vision Michael has predicted many of the technologies
                see today like PhoneGap's native features and discusions on a 
                <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2015/03/30/the-growing-precariat-why-a-basic-income-is-needed/">universal wage</a>
                as machine learning becomes strong AI. 
                <br/> <br/>
                Michael brings this vision to the work he does with his clients to deliver creative solutions.
                He can relate to startup businesses having co-founded many and learning first hard the challenges they face. 
                He sees and understand technology litterally as a part of nature, having it's own observable traits
                and he teaches these to his partners and clients so that they may align themselves best with the way technology really wants to work.
